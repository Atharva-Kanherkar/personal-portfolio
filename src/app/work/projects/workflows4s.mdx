## Overview

**Workflows4s** is a Scala-based project designed to provide developers with an interactive and intuitive interface for visualizing workflows and monitoring their execution in real time.  
The project includes a reactive frontend built with Scala.js and Tyrian, a type-safe backend API using Tapir, and automated deployment through Docker and Fly.io.

---

## Features

- **Reactive Frontend**: A Tyrian-based Scala.js UI following the Model-View-Update architecture for predictable state management.  
- **Type-Safe API**: Tapir endpoints enforce client-server contract consistency and generate OpenAPI documentation.  
- **Workflow Visualization**: Execution traces are converted into interactive Mermaid.js diagrams rendered in the browser.  
- **Automated Deployment**: Full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for building Docker images and deploying to Fly.io.  

---

## How It Works

1. **Frontend Interaction**: Users interact with the Tyrian UI in the browser to view workflow instances.  
2. **API Requests**: The UI sends type-safe HTTP requests to the Tapir API server.  
3. **Data Processing**: The server executes workflow logic, providing instance data and execution traces.  
4. **Visualization**: Scala.js transforms the data into Mermaid syntax, which is rendered as SVG diagrams in the browser.  
5. **Deployment**: The backend server serves both API endpoints and static frontend assets from a single Docker container on Fly.io.
