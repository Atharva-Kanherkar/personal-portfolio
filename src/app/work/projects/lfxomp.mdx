## Overview

**Zowe App Store UI** is an open-source initiative under the Open Mainframe Project aimed at modernizing mainframe systems by providing a user-friendly web interface.  
During the Summer 2024 LFX Mentorship Program, I had the opportunity to contribute to this project, focusing on enhancing the server's stability and improving the development environment.

## Contributions

- **Refactored Directory Creation Logic**:  
  Introduced a helper function, `ensureDirSync()`, to streamline the directory creation process, reducing redundancy and improving code maintainability.

- **Addressed SAF Keyring Error**:  
  Implemented a temporary logging mechanism to capture SAF keyring errors, allowing the server to continue running while the issue is being investigated.

- **Enhanced Developer Documentation**:  
  Updated the README with detailed instructions on setting up the development environment, including Node.js installation on Windows, handling common errors, and configuring the Zowe environment.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js  
- **Version Control**: Git  
- **Documentation**: Markdown

## Challenges & Learnings

- **Understanding Legacy Code**:  
  Navigating and refactoring legacy code required a deep understanding of the existing architecture and careful planning to ensure stability.

- **Security Considerations**:  
  Addressing the SAF keyring error involved delving into mainframe security mechanisms, highlighting the complexity of mainframe systems.

- **Community Collaboration**:  
  Collaborating with mentors and the open-source community emphasized the importance of communication and teamwork in software development.

## Future Directions

- **SAF Keyring Error Resolution**:  
  Investigate and implement a permanent fix for the SAF keyring error to enhance server reliability.

- **Documentation Expansion**:  
  Continue to improve developer documentation to facilitate onboarding and contribution from the broader community.

- **Feature Enhancements**:  
  Explore opportunities to add new features to the Zowe App Store UI, aligning with community needs and project goals.
