# distance

You think distance is measured in miles.<br />

It's not.<br />

<br />

It's the silence that grows between two people<br />

until you can't hear each other at all.<br />

<br />

You'll never know about the salt-stains on my pillow,<br />

or the ink that blurred in my journal—<br />

a book of you,<br />

now soaked with missing you.<br />

I still wear the black coat I bought,<br />

the one you were supposed to love.<br />

I wrap myself in the ghost of your excitement,<br />

a regret I can't take off.<br />

<br />

Some days it feels heavy,<br />

but some days, it just feels warm.<br />

I scream your name sometimes<br />

Only to hope you'll listen<br />

But I can not be loud to you<br />

I can not scream<br />

Because I know that you don't like it<br />

So I stay quiet.<br />

And maybe that's why<br />

I never take off the coat.
