# The Big 2025: The Age of Vibe Coding

It's 2025. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is here.

We've grown from asking LLMs to write a few lines of code to… letting them run everything. Agents spinning up workflows, pipelines building themselves, and us? Just "vibing" while they do the work.

I do it too. Not gonna lie.

But it's not all smooth jazz. There are caveats — big ones — and I wanted to jot them down for anyone new to the world of vibe coding.

Let's break it into scenarios: how and why vibe coding can work — and where it absolutely falls apart. If one of these scenarios resonates, take it and run with it.

## Scenario 1: The Blind Autopilot World

This is where most people get it wrong.

They hand Claude (or whatever model) a task, watch it spit code, and when something breaks, they go — "FIX IT!" — without even reading the error.

It's kind of hilarious if you think about it.

Because LLMs aren't actually "thinking." They're predicting. Pattern completion machines. Non-deterministic by design.

Programming, on the other hand, is deterministic. Every line of code has to do what it says, every time. That's the core conflict: LLMs live in probabilities; code lives in precision.

So what happens?

We end up with piles of code that "sort of works." Code we never read, never understand, and never maintain — until it breaks in production. And when it does, it's chaos. Because that code wasn't written by a person, it was summoned.

**The truth: every line of code is a burden.**

And that burden multiplies when you let models write without oversight.

So yeah, the "autonomous coding" dream — that's cute, but it's not real. It's a probabilistic machine pretending to be an engineer. And probability doesn't debug.

## Scenario 2: You're Tony Stark, and It's Your JARVIS

This is where it actually works.

You're in control. The model's your assistant — not your replacement.

You ask, it helps.
You think, it executes.
You debug together.

That's the sweet spot.
Not automation. **Augmentation.**

You're still the engineer. You understand the architecture, you know why something's built the way it is — and the model handles the repetitive stuff, the boilerplate, the docs, the tedious parsing of APIs. You focus on design, logic, and intent. It focuses on flow.

You know the architecture. It asks you that should it install this package? This dependency? Should it? You know this package is not performative, and you decide that no, even though a lot of large, slow codebases have used it and thats why its "predicting" that this package could be the one, you choose another. **That's the art. And it is NOT dead. It will never be dead.**

That's not "vibe coding." That's **collaborative coding.**
And that's the only version that scales.

Production environments are made for performance, a billions of internet users wanting speed, accuracy and efficiency. If you mess that up, that's a problem.

I think, in the age of LLMs, its more about **code reviewing**, then code writing. **Why are you doing** what is more important, then just doing it.

Anyways, I hope this was helpful. It is my first time writing a blog, so please be patient with me, and I hope we "Scale"!
