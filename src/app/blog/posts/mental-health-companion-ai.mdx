# Building a Mental Health Companion: An AI-Powered Journey Toward Wellness

## The Problem: Mental Health Needs Better Digital Tools

Mental health care is often inaccessible, expensive, and stigmatized. While therapy and professional support are invaluable, there's a gap in everyday tools that help people track their mental health journey, preserve meaningful memories, and receive immediate support when they need it most.

I wanted to create something that could fill this gap—a comprehensive platform that combines **therapeutic journaling**, **memory preservation**, **AI-powered insights**, and **gamified wellness tracking** into one cohesive experience. The result is a mental health companion that's always there, never judges, and helps users understand their mental health patterns over time.

## What Does It Do?

The platform is built around several core features that work together to support mental wellness:

### 1. AI-Powered Journaling with Sentiment Analysis

Users can write journal entries with rich media support (text, images, audio, video), and the AI automatically:
- Detects emotional sentiment and mood
- Generates a wellness score (0-10 scale)
- Provides supportive, personalized messages
- Identifies thematic patterns across entries
- Tracks mood dimensions (energy, anxiety, stress)

The AI doesn't just store entries—it **understands them** and provides meaningful feedback that helps users gain insights into their emotional patterns.

### 2. Memory Vault with Privacy-First Design

The Memory Vault allows users to preserve precious memories with:
- **Zero-knowledge encryption**: Files are encrypted client-side before upload. Even I can't access them.
- **Favorite People Management**: Store important contacts with support messages
- **AI Walkthrough**: An interactive conversational AI that helps users process memories therapeutically
  - Real-time streaming conversations
  - Text-to-speech with natural voice synthesis
  - Context-aware therapeutic responses

### 3. Comprehensive Daily Check-ins

Users can track their mental health daily with:
- Mood, energy, sleep quality, stress, and anxiety levels
- Discreet safety monitoring (self-harm thoughts)
- Positive behavior tracking (exercise, nutrition, medication)
- Gratitude and accomplishment logging
- One check-in per day to prevent over-tracking

### 4. Evidence-Based Clinical Assessments

The platform includes standardized mental health questionnaires:
- **PHQ-9** (Depression)
- **GAD-7** (Anxiety)
- **PCL-5** (PTSD)
- **MDQ** (Bipolar)
- **AUDIT** (Alcohol Use)

Each assessment provides automated scoring, severity classification, clinical interpretations, and evidence-based recommendations.

### 5. Gamification & Rewards

To encourage consistent engagement:
- Points and levels system
- Streak tracking (journaling, check-ins, no self-harm, positive mood)
- Achievement unlocking across multiple categories
- Milestone and behavior rewards

### 6. Crisis Management

The platform includes robust crisis support:
- Crisis event logging with severity tracking
- Trigger pattern identification
- Intervention tracking (hotline, ER, therapy)
- Safety planning tools
- Follow-up monitoring

## How I Built It: The Tech Stack

### Frontend Architecture

I chose **Next.js 15** with **React 19** as the foundation because:
- App Router provides excellent routing and layouts
- Server-side rendering improves performance
- Built-in API routes simplify backend integration
- Turbopack makes development blazingly fast

The UI is built with:
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first styling for rapid development
- **shadcn/ui**: High-quality, accessible components built on Radix UI
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth, professional animations
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Type-safe form validation

### Backend Architecture

The backend is an **Express.js** server with TypeScript:
- **RESTful API** for standard operations
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for real-time AI streaming
- **Socket.IO** for bidirectional communication
- **Multer** for file upload handling
- **Sharp** for image optimization

### Database Design

**PostgreSQL** with **Prisma ORM** provides:
- Type-safe database queries
- Automatic migrations
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Connection pooling for performance

The schema includes 20+ models covering everything from journal entries to clinical assessments to reward systems.

### AI Integration: The Heart of the Platform

#### Google Gemini for Conversational AI

I integrated **Google Gemini API** for:
- Real-time streaming conversations (< 500ms time-to-first-token)
- Sentiment analysis and mood detection
- Thematic analysis of journal entries
- Context-aware therapeutic responses
- Wellness score calculation

The streaming implementation was particularly challenging. I used Server-Sent Events to push AI responses to the frontend in real-time, creating a conversational experience that feels natural and immediate.

#### Google Cloud Text-to-Speech

For the AI walkthrough feature, I integrated **Google Cloud TTS** to give the AI companion a voice:
- Natural-sounding neural voices
- **Intelligent caching system** that saves 70-80% on costs
- Common phrases pre-cached for instant playback
- Cost per session: ~$0.02 with caching

### Storage: Privacy Meets Functionality

I use **DigitalOcean Spaces** (S3-compatible) with **two separate buckets**:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Bucket**: Files are encrypted client-side using AES-GCM before upload. The server never sees unencrypted content.
2. **Server-Managed Bucket**: Files that need AI analysis are stored here, encrypted in transit and at rest.

This dual-bucket approach lets users choose their privacy level based on their comfort and needs.

### Infrastructure: Building for Resilience

Mental health apps need to be **reliable**. I implemented several patterns to ensure uptime:

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
Prevents cascading failures when external services (like AI) are down. If failures exceed a threshold, the circuit "opens" and requests fail fast with fallback responses.

#### Exponential Backoff Retry
Temporary failures are retried with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s...) to handle transient issues without overwhelming services.

#### Rate Limiting
60 requests per minute per user prevents abuse and ensures fair resource allocation.

#### Fallback Chain
If AI services fail, the system gracefully degrades to static supportive messages. Users always get a response, even if it's not AI-generated.

#### Health Monitoring
Automatic health checks monitor service status and automatically recover failed services.

## Key Implementation Details

### Real-Time AI Streaming

The streaming AI walkthrough was the most technically challenging feature. Here's how it works:

1. User starts a walkthrough for a specific memory
2. Backend creates a session and retrieves memory context
3. Frontend opens an SSE connection to `/api/walkthrough-v2/stream/:sessionId`
4. When the user sends a message, it's posted to `/api/walkthrough-v2/respond/:sessionId`
5. The backend streams the AI response token-by-token through SSE
6. Each message is converted to speech and cached
7. Frontend displays text and plays audio seamlessly

This creates a conversational experience that feels natural and immediate, like chatting with a supportive friend.

### Voice Caching Strategy

Text-to-Speech can get expensive fast. To optimize costs, I implemented a three-tier caching strategy:

1. **Warm Cache**: Common phrases like greetings are pre-cached on startup
2. **Session Cache**: Repeated phrases in a session are cached
3. **Global Cache**: Frequently used therapeutic responses are cached globally

This reduced TTS costs by 70-80%, making the feature sustainable.

### Privacy-First File Encryption

For zero-knowledge files, I implemented client-side AES-GCM encryption:

```typescript
// Client-side encryption before upload
const encryptFile = async (file: File, key: CryptoKey) => {
  const iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
  const fileData = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const encryptedData = await crypto.subtle.encrypt(
    { name: 'AES-GCM', iv },
    key,
    fileData
  );
  return { encryptedData, iv };
};
```

The encryption key never leaves the client. Even if someone breaches the server, they can't decrypt the files.

### Gamification Engine

The rewards system tracks:
- **Points**: Earned for journaling, check-ins, streaks
- **Levels**: Progress as points accumulate
- **Streaks**: Consecutive days of positive behaviors
- **Achievements**: Milestone-based unlocks

The system is designed to encourage healthy behaviors without being manipulative. It celebrates progress without punishing lapses.

## Challenges I Faced

### 1. Balancing Privacy and AI Features

AI needs data to be helpful, but mental health data is sensitive. The solution was the dual-bucket approach: users choose whether each piece of content is zero-knowledge encrypted or AI-accessible.

### 2. Cost Management for AI Services

Running AI features at scale can get expensive fast. I solved this with:
- Voice caching (70-80% savings)
- Circuit breakers to prevent runaway costs
- Rate limiting per user
- Gemini's free tier for development

### 3. Therapeutic Accuracy

I'm not a therapist, and neither is the AI. The solution:
- Use evidence-based assessment tools
- Never claim to diagnose or treat
- Always recommend professional help for serious concerns
- Design the AI companion as a supportive friend, not a therapist

### 4. Crisis Handling

When someone is in crisis, the app needs to respond appropriately:
- High-risk responses in assessments trigger immediate resource display
- Crisis event logging with follow-up tracking
- Integration with crisis hotlines and emergency services
- Never promise what the app can't deliver

### 5. User Engagement Without Manipulation

Gamification can be powerful, but mental health apps shouldn't be addictive. I designed the reward system to:
- Limit check-ins to one per day
- Reward healthy behaviors, not just app usage
- Never punish users for taking breaks
- Celebrate progress without inducing guilt

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Query Optimization
- Connection pooling prevents connection exhaustion
- Prisma's query optimization reduces response times
- Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields

### Frontend Performance
- Next.js automatic code splitting
- Image optimization with Sharp
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Server-side rendering for initial loads

### Caching Strategies
- Voice responses cached indefinitely
- Session data cached in memory
- Static resources cached at CDN edge

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Better Auth** for secure session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks
- CSRF protection on state-changing operations

### Data Protection
- TLS/SSL for all data in transit
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Client-side encryption for sensitive files
- Regular security audits

### Input Validation
- Zod schema validation on all inputs
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- File upload validation and sanitization
- XSS protection in React components

## What's Next?

### Planned Features

1. **Mobile App**: Native iOS and Android apps for better accessibility
2. **Therapist Portal**: Allow therapists to monitor clients (with consent)
3. **Community Features**: Anonymous peer support groups
4. **Advanced Analytics**: ML-powered insights into mental health patterns
5. **Integration with Wearables**: Track sleep, activity, heart rate
6. **Multi-language Support**: Make the platform accessible globally
7. **Voice Journal Entries**: Speak your thoughts instead of typing

### Technical Improvements

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Split services for better scalability
2. **GraphQL API**: More efficient data fetching
3. **WebSockets**: Replace SSE for bidirectional streaming
4. **Redis Caching**: Improve performance for frequently accessed data
5. **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment with zero downtime

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start with the MVP
I initially wanted to build everything at once. Focusing on core features first (journaling, check-ins, AI analysis) allowed me to validate the concept before adding complexity.

### 2. Privacy Isn't Optional
Mental health data is some of the most sensitive information people have. Privacy-first design isn't a feature—it's a requirement.

### 3. AI Is a Tool, Not a Solution
AI is powerful, but it's not magic. It needs context, constraints, and fallbacks. The best AI features combine automation with human-centered design.

### 4. Resilience Matters
External services fail. Networks drop. The circuit breaker pattern and fallback chains were essential for reliability.

### 5. Cost Optimization Early
I should have implemented voice caching from day one. Waiting until costs became a problem was stressful. Build optimization in from the start.

### 6. User Feedback Is Gold
The features users request aren't always the features they need. Observing how people actually use the app revealed surprising insights.
