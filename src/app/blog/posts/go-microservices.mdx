Go started as my language of choice for building fast CLI tools, but over time it became my go-to for **backend microservices**.  
In this post, I’ll share my journey: starting with a simple CLI currency converter (`Go Cash`), then Dockerizing it, and finally deploying it on AWS with Kubernetes.

## Why Go?
- Minimalistic standard library, batteries included.  
- Goroutines + channels for lightweight concurrency.  
- Easy cross-compilation for different platforms.  

## Scaling from Local to Cloud
1. **CLI Tool** → quick currency converter.  
2. **Dockerization** → portable, easy to ship.  
3. **Kubernetes Deployment** → auto-scaling, resilient infra.  

## Lessons Learned
- Always structure Go projects with clear packages.  
- Logging and monitoring are as important as the code itself.  
- Cloud-native thinking changes how you design backends.  

Go taught me to value **simplicity and speed** — and that small projects can evolve into production-ready services.
