# death

Death was brave enough to come to me.<br />
I was reminiscing about my beloved.<br />
Every night, every morning.<br />
She told me, it was my time to come with her.<br />
I told her, I would not succumb to her.<br />
She said I did not have an option, that I had to go.<br />
I said I will not go until I complete this poem.<br />

She waited, draped in shadows,<br />
while I summoned the ghost of her —<br />
the one I loved beyond reason,<br />
beyond the rules of this cruel world.<br />

She was never mine. Not truly.<br />
But every glance she gave me,<br />
every word she spoke into the cold,<br />
felt like God apologizing for making me.<br />

I remember her laugh —<br />
not how it sounded, but how it felt.<br />
Like being seen. Like sunlight through a crack<br />
in a place that knew only winter.<br />

I loved her braveness.<br />
not because it was loud,<br />
but because it was her.<br />
Like how the sea hurts itself at the stone,<br />
knowing it may never win.<br />
She tried.<br />

I loved her in silence.<br />
Loved her from a distance I never chose.<br />
She belonged to someone else,<br />
or maybe to the world.<br />
But never to me.<br />

And yet, every inch of my ruin<br />
was shaped by her absence.<br />

Death watched,<br />
not cruel, not kind.<br />
Just waiting.<br />

"You write of love as if it saved you,"<br />
she said.<br />
"No," I whispered.<br />
"I write of love because it ruined me —<br />
and I want the world to know her name<br />
before I disappear."<br />

She reached for me again.<br />
I recoiled.<br />
"There is still one memory I haven't bled onto the page."<br />

The last time I saw her,<br />
she touched my face —<br />
not with affection,<br />
but with pity.<br />

And I knew.<br />
I was never her home.<br />
Just a room she passed through<br />
on the way to someone else.<br />

Still…<br />
I would die a thousand times<br />
just to be the floor beneath her feet<br />
one more time.<br />

Now, Death may take me.<br />
But let her know —<br />
even in the dark,<br />
I only saw her.
