# corpse

i don't know why sleeping is difficult
at least i get to dream of you
maybe because it's all a dream
and i don't want to wake up
so i just don't sleep
thinking of you

sometimes i go to see the burning corpses
just to see that they're burning alone
sometimes no one to cry for them

are they dreaming too?
or pretending to sleep?
a nightmare for someone, somewhere
who still loves them
but couldn't gather up to show up
to see them burn

but at least i'm alive
does that make it better?
no.
i don't know.

who gets to decide, who gets to live and who does not?
who gets to live with love, who dies alone
who gets to dream something beautiful
and who gets to live it
the world isn't fair

so i don't wanna dream
and I don't wanna sleep
so i spiral around
thinking about you
like a geometric progression

going on
until infinity
and I accept it
because
i don't get to decide
only if I could.
