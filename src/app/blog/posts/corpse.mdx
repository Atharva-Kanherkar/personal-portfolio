# corpse

i don't know why sleeping is difficult<br />
at least i get to dream of you<br />
maybe because it's all a dream<br />
and i don't want to wake up<br />
so i just don't sleep<br />
thinking of you<br />

sometimes i go to see the burning corpses<br />
just to see that they're burning alone<br />
sometimes no one to cry for them<br />

are they dreaming too?<br />
or pretending to sleep?<br />
a nightmare for someone, somewhere<br />
who still loves them<br />
but couldn't gather up to show up<br />
to see them burn<br />

but at least i'm alive<br />
does that make it better?<br />
no.<br />
i don't know.<br />

who gets to decide, who gets to live and who does not?<br />
who gets to live with love, who dies alone<br />
who gets to dream something beautiful<br />
and who gets to live it<br />
the world isn't fair<br />

so i don't wanna dream<br />
and I don't wanna sleep<br />
so i spiral around<br />
thinking about you<br />
like a geometric progression<br />

going on<br />
until infinity<br />
and I accept it<br />
because<br />
i don't get to decide<br />
only if I could.
