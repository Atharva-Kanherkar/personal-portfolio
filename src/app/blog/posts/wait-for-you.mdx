# I wait for you

From summers to winters,<br />

Weathers change slowly sometimes when it's not with you.<br />

I wont lie that I don't see the colors,<br />
But inside I really don't wanna see them.<br />
I just close my eyes, and stop experiencing them.<br />

I wait, I wait for you<br />

I wanna experience the colors with you<br />

The changing seasons and their changing colors.<br />

When the breeze flows inside, I just close my windows.<br />

In the pursuit of experiencing it with you<br />

But I know<br />

It's hard for us to do that everytime<br />

But I will wait<br />

I do wait, I wait for you<br />

I want to laugh, but it dies as soon as it reaches my throat.<br />

Because you're not there to laugh with me.<br />

I know hopeless romantics do not have a grave to rest on,<br />
But I have the hope that you'll come<br />

So<br />

I wait, I wait for you<br />

Windows still closed, dirt gathering, silence thickens<br />

I sometimes open them,<br />

But every sound I hear,<br />
Every shadow I see<br />

Keeps pretending it's you<br />

Deep down I know it's never you<br />

But<br />

I wait, I wait for you<br />

Eyes still not allowed to see the colors,<br />

Because who are these eyes when you don't reflect in them?<br />

They'll get to see colors only when they see you<br />

So for the sake of them,<br />

I wait, I wait for you<br />

I don't enter happy places<br />

None of them work, anymore<br />

You're the only happy place where I belong<br />

So,<br />

I wait, I wait for you<br />

I wonder what you do when I'm thinking about you,<br />

I wonder do you feel the same<br />

I wonder do you too wait for me,<br />

I wonder do you take my name<br />

I hope you do<br />

And even if you do not,<br />

I wait, I wait for you
